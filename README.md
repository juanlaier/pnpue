Description:-
* A simple command line utility that will give a better output to the pnputil.exe -e command to help identify old drivers you no longer need.

Install:-
* You just need the .EXE file from the github page, it runs on it's own. Unless you want to compile it yourself. I used MS Compiler v18 (Visual C++ 2013) 64-bit to compile it.

Use:-
* Just run it in a console window.

Uninstall:-
* Just delete the .EXE from your system, it creates no registry entries or files.

About:-
* Coded in C++ 11 for Microsoft Compiler. It might compile on GCC/LLVM but some modifications may need to be made.

Updates:-
* Download from http://github.com/msdsgn/pnpue.

Licence:-
* Zero warranty public domain.
